The experiment here is an adapted and simplified version of the experiment [Onat et al., 2014](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0093254#s2). /This experiment dataset belongs to the "An extensive dataset of eye movements during viewing of complex images" [Wilming et al., 2017](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata2016126#ref-CR23).

In this experiment only 2 of the 4 original categories of complex images are going to be displayed: natural and urban images. During this task subjects were instructed to passively study the images carefully during 6 seconds. Images were presented in a completely randomized order.
