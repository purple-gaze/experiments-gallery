# Sliding window eye tracking experiment 

Run `sliding_window.py` to start the experiment.\
This task was tested both on Windows 10 and MacOS.

**Requierements:** \
`psychopy >= 2020.1.2`

The example eye tracking assessment of concussion is inspired by Samadani et al. (2016) and Samadani et al. (2015). 

This task has been designed to detect disconjugate eye movements as a biomarker of structural brain injury and concussion.  

During the task, participants are asked to watch a video through a moving aperture on the screen. There is no standardised stimuli for this task in literature, so a sample video made from stock videos is used as an example.
